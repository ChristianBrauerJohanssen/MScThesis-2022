# Macroprudential Policy and the Housing Market - *Quantifying Unequal Policy Impact Across Age and Wealth*
This is the working repository for my Master's thesis in Economics at the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.economics.ku.dk/).

## Replicating the results
TBA

**Parameterisation:**

Can be found in the model initialisation in [TBA](). 

**Tables:**

TBA
 <!-- a normal html comment 
The average MPCs in Table 3 and MPCs from Table 4 sensitivity analysis are also present in notebook. As default, the MPCs are cross-computed in the simulation part, but to create the non cross-computed MPCs a boolean for ``cross_compute=False`` can be set when initiating the model.

**Figures:**

TBA
 <!-- 
Each notebook will plot the figures associated with the given model.
